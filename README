APIApp.py is a base class for Google AppEngine (GAE) applications to provide
methods for a ("dirty" Flickr style) web based API. 

For intents and purposes it doesn't really do anything except provide handy
wrappers to send "method succeeded" and "method failed" responses.

It does not provide hooks for third-party token-based API access (or
"delegation" if you're feeling the need for to talk "shop").

It follows the "dirty" Flickr way of doing things (a root "rsp" element,
returning 200 OK for errors and so on) because it's what I know and, more
importantly, I actually like it.

Please feel free to subclass the "send_*" methods and others if this makes you
cry.

EXAMPLE (this really is all it does...)

 from APIApp import APIApp

 class MyAPI (APIApp) :

      def __init__ (self) :

      	  # the default format is 'xml'
          # ...by default

      	  default_format = 'json'

          APIApp.__init__(self, default_format)

      def get (self) :
          
          if self.request.get('name') :

             out = {'hello' : name }                                      
             self.api_ok(out)

          else :
             self.api_error(999, 'Self destruct!')
